The 'traditional roguelike' I've always wanted to make.

This was prompted by reading [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Robert Nylstrom and both being excited by the concepts and having no real game development experience that might give them context. I figured I love Nethack, so why not try and hack out my own version. I've got ideas for a concept I actually think would be fun, but the purpose of this isn't really to get a working game, it's to play, get lost in architecture, build tools and have fun coding.

## Plan

**TODO** I'd like to lay out some goals and non-goals, for now at a high level it's "don't be too clever too early" and give myself room to iterate and make mistakes.
